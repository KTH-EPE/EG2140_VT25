    "### Hyperparameters\n",
    "All estimators have parameters (often called hyper-parameters in the literature) that can be tuned. The generalization power of an estimator often critically depends on a few parameters. For example a [RandomForestRegressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html#sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor) has a **n_estimators parameter** that determines the number of trees in the forest, and a **max_depth** parameter that determines the maximum depth of each tree. Quite often, it is not clear what the exact values of these parameters should be since they depend on the data at hand.\n",

    "Scikit-learn provides tools to automatically find the best parameter combinations (via cross-validation). In the following example, we randomly search over the parameter space of a random forest with a [RandomizedSearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV) object. When the search is over, the [RandomizedSearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV) behaves as a RandomForestRegressor that has been fitted with the best set of parameters.
